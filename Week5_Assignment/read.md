# LAB EXERCISE on DEEP LEARNING - 1:
## (MLP or Multi-Layered ANN):

### 1. Construct a Multi-Layer Neural Network
- Construct a multi-layer neural net (you choose the number of layers â€“ and justify your choice), with two input values `x1` and `x2` that outputs `1` if `x1 > x2` and `0` otherwise.

### 2. Predicting House Prices using Deep Learning
- You have been given a dataset of house prices with various features such as the number of bedrooms, size of the house, how many years old, and location. Your task is to build a deep learning model to predict the price of a house based on these features.

## HOUSING RENTAL MARKET DATA:
| Serial No.  | No. of bedrooms | Carpet Area (sq. ft.)  | Years Old | Location | Rent (per month) Rs. |
